If you want to push files to Bitbucket and also update an S3 bucket in real-time without using a CI/CD pipeline, you'll need to set up a system that listens for file changes in your Bitbucket repository and synchronizes with your S3 bucket.

Here's a step-by-step outline of how to do this:

Option 1: Using a Local Script to Sync Bitbucket and S3
If you don't want to use a CI/CD pipeline, you can create a script that runs on your local machine or on a server that will:

Monitor your Bitbucket repository for changes (via webhooks or manual pulls).
Sync changes to the AWS S3 bucket using the AWS CLI or SDK.
Here’s how you could do this:

Step 1: Install AWS CLI
Ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the appropriate credentials:

bash
Copy code
aws configure
Make sure to set up your AWS access key, secret access key, and default region.

Step 2: Set Up a Webhook in Bitbucket
You can set up a webhook in Bitbucket to notify your server or local machine when a commit is made to the repository.

Go to your Bitbucket repository.
Click on Repository settings → Webhooks → Add webhook.
Enter a URL for your server that will listen for these notifications. You could set up a small web server or use a service like ngrok to tunnel to your local machine if you're testing locally.
Step 3: Create a Webhook Listener Script
You can use a lightweight web server (e.g., written in Python with Flask) to listen for Bitbucket webhook events.

Example (Python with Flask):

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    payload = request.json
    # Optionally, you can check the payload to ensure it’s the right event type.
    print(f"Received payload: {payload}")
    
    # Pull latest changes from Bitbucket
    subprocess.run(["git", "pull", "origin", "main"])
    
    # Sync with S3
    subprocess.run(["aws", "s3", "sync", ".", "s3://your-bucket-name", "--delete"])

    return '', 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
Step 4: Run the Server
Run this Python server on your machine or on a server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Now, every time Bitbucket pushes a webhook to /webhook, it will pull the latest changes from the repository and sync them to your S3 bucket.

Step 5: Test the Setup
Push a commit to your Bitbucket repository.
Check your S3 bucket to see if the files have been updated.
Option 2: Using a Git Hook with AWS Sync
Alternatively, you can set up a git post-commit hook that pushes changes to S3 after each commit.

Step 1: Create a Git Hook
Create a file named post-commit inside the .git/hooks folder in your repository.

Example (bash script):

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# Post commit hook to sync files with S3

# Sync to AWS S3 after commit
aws s3 sync ./ s3://your-bucket-name --delete
Make sure this script is executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
Step 2: Sync to S3
Now, after every commit, the post-commit hook will sync your files with the S3 bucket.

Option 3: Using a Scheduled Task or Cron Job
If you don’t want a real-time sync and are okay with syncing periodically, you can use a cron job (Linux) or a scheduled task (Windows) to periodically sync the files with S3.

For example, you could set up a cron job to run aws s3 sync every 5 minutes:

bash
Copy code
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/your/repo && git pull && aws s3 sync . s3://your-bucket-name --delete
This would sync your Bitbucket repository to S3 every 5 minutes.

Conclusion
Real-time syncing without CI/CD is possible using a webhook listener or git hooks to detect changes and sync to S3.
You can use AWS CLI and scripts to sync files from Bitbucket to S3 as soon as changes are pushed.
If real-time syncing is too complex, consider using cron jobs to periodically sync your files.

To achieve an automated way to sync your Bitbucket repository with an AWS S3 bucket without manually intervening (and without using a full CI/CD pipeline), you can set up an automated process using Bitbucket Webhooks, a small server (or serverless solution), and AWS CLI for the synchronization.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to implement a fully automated system:

1. Set Up a Webhook in Bitbucket
Bitbucket supports webhooks, which can send notifications to an external server (your webhook listener) whenever changes are pushed to your repository.

Steps to Set Up Webhook in Bitbucket:
Go to your Bitbucket repository.
Click on the Settings tab (gear icon).
Select Webhooks from the left sidebar.
Click Add webhook.
In the URL field, input the endpoint URL where your webhook listener will reside (e.g., http://your-server.com/webhook).
Choose the events you want to listen for (e.g., Push events).
Click Save.
2. Create a Webhook Listener to Automate Syncing
You can set up a Webhook Listener using a simple server-side script. When the webhook from Bitbucket is received, this listener will trigger the synchronization process to AWS S3.

We'll use Python and Flask to create this listener. This script will listen for Bitbucket webhook notifications, pull the latest changes from your Bitbucket repository, and then sync those changes to your S3 bucket.

Install the Required Tools:
Make sure you have Python, Flask, and AWS CLI installed:

bash
Copy code
# Install Flask (for the server)
pip install Flask

# Install AWS CLI
pip install awscli
Python Script for Webhook Listener:
python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request
import subprocess
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define your repository path and S3 bucket
REPO_PATH = '/path/to/your/local/repo'
S3_BUCKET = 's3://your-bucket-name'

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    try:
        # Fetch payload from Bitbucket Webhook
        payload = request.json
        print(f"Received webhook payload: {payload}")

        # Verify that the webhook is from Bitbucket (optional)
        # You can check the repository name or any other identifying details

        # Step 1: Pull latest changes from the Bitbucket repository
        os.chdir(REPO_PATH)  # Change working directory to your repository path
        subprocess.run(['git', 'pull', 'origin', 'main'], check=True)

        # Step 2: Sync the repository files to AWS S3
        subprocess.run(['aws', 's3', 'sync', REPO_PATH, S3_BUCKET, '--delete'], check=True)
        
        return '', 200  # Acknowledge that the webhook was processed correctly

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing webhook: {e}")
        return 'Internal Server Error', 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
3. Deploy the Webhook Listener
Deploy this script on a server that can handle incoming requests from Bitbucket's webhook. Here are some options:

Option 1: Local Machine (for testing)
You can use tools like ngrok to expose your local development server to the internet:

Install ngrok:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g ngrok
Expose the Flask server locally:

bash
Copy code
ngrok http 5000
This will give you a URL like http://<random-id>.ngrok.io, which you can use as the webhook URL in Bitbucket.

Option 2: Deploy on a Cloud Server
If you want this to run more reliably, deploy the script on a cloud server (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, etc.):

Create a virtual machine (VM).
SSH into the VM, install the necessary dependencies (Python, Flask, AWS CLI), and run the Python script.
Open port 5000 (or whichever port your app is using) to allow external access.
Set up the public IP of your server as the webhook URL in Bitbucket.
Option 3: Serverless Option (AWS Lambda + API Gateway)
You can also set this up serverlessly using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. This way, you don’t need to manage a server manually.

AWS Lambda: Create a Python-based Lambda function to handle the webhook and trigger the S3 sync.
API Gateway: Set up an API Gateway endpoint that Bitbucket can send requests to.
In the Lambda function, pull the latest code from Bitbucket and sync it to S3 (similar to the Python script above).
4. Ensure Proper Permissions
Make sure your server or Lambda has the appropriate IAM permissions to access and sync to your S3 bucket. You can set up an IAM role for this:

Go to IAM in the AWS Console.

Create a new policy for S3 access (if one doesn’t exist already):

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:Sync",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
Attach this policy to the instance or Lambda role.

5. Test the Setup
Once everything is set up:

Push a change to your Bitbucket repository.
Check the logs of your Flask server or Lambda function to see if the webhook is received and the files are synced to S3.
Go to your S3 bucket to verify the files are updated.
Optional Enhancements:
Security: Add authentication to your webhook to prevent unauthorized calls (using a secret token or signature).
Error Handling: Implement retries or logging to better handle failures (e.g., network issues, permission errors).
Scaling: If your usage grows, you can consider scaling the service to handle multiple webhooks at once.
Conclusion
This approach allows you to automatically sync your Bitbucket repository to an S3 bucket every time you push to Bitbucket, using a webhook to trigger a Python server or Lambda function that handles the sync.
